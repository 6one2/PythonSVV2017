# Analysis of the effect of ELF-MF over Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV) in humans
project started Dr S. Villard 2017

## create a subject object that gather all subject related data and methods

1. check for Subjective Visual Vesrtical over 2.5ยบ in control condition
Remove subjects that exhibit SVV angle over 2.5ยบ during the control condition where not stimulation were applied.

2. graphical representation of SVV data with outliers in solid dots

3. Analysis over "good participants"
 - create new table with delta-SVV as difference SVVcond - SVVctrl

4. Export data for Analysis

5. Use R for repeated measure ANOVA and post-hoc
